# Thanks and credit to Jonathan for the starter code

# Setting working directory
setwd("~/github/PS5")

# Setting seed so everyone randomizes similarly
set.seed(12435)
# For reading in the data
options(stringsAsFactors=F)
library(foreign)

# read in data
anes <- read.dta("anes_timeseries_2012_stata12.dta")

## model Obama's feeling thermometer score as function
## of Clinton's feeling thermometer score
model1 <- lm(ft_dpc ~ ft_hclinton, anes)

## make a prediction for a single observation with
## hypothetical clinton score of 77
predict(model1, data.frame(ft_hclinton=77))
## we would expect a Obama score of 71.7

## Question 1
## randomly subset the data into two partitions
## use "training set" to build at least three models 
## of Obama's feeling thermometer score
## document carefully how you deal with missingness
